ARM64 Architecture Directory Overview

This document provides an overview of the arch/arm64 directory in the TOS-7 operating system source code. The directory contains essential files for the ARM64 architecture, each playing a specific role in the system’s functionality. Below is a detailed description of each file:
	•	boot.S: This assembly file manages the initial boot process for the ARM64 architecture. It sets up the environment necessary for the kernel to operate, including initializing registers and setting up the stack.
	•	context.S: Contains assembly routines for context switching between tasks or processes. This is crucial for multitasking, allowing the CPU to switch from one process to another efficiently.
	•	context.c: Provides C implementations and interfaces for context management functions. It works in conjunction with context.S to facilitate process scheduling and state saving/restoring.
	•	cpuwrap.c: Offers CPU-specific wrapper functions that abstract low-level operations. These functions provide a standardized interface for higher-level code to interact with CPU features.
	•	cpuwrap.h: The header file declaring the interfaces and structures used by cpuwrap.c. It defines macros and function prototypes related to CPU operations.
	•	link.ld: The linker script that defines the memory layout of the compiled kernel. It specifies how different sections of the code and data are arranged in memory.
	•	mmu.S: Assembly code for managing the Memory Management Unit (MMU). It includes routines for setting up and configuring virtual memory mappings.
	•	mmu.c: Contains C functions that complement mmu.S, providing higher-level interfaces for memory management tasks such as allocating and freeing virtual memory.
	•	mmu.h: The header file declaring structures and functions related to the MMU. It defines data types and function prototypes used in mmu.c and mmu.S.
	•	ptdefs.h: Defines constants and structures related to page tables. It includes definitions for page sizes, table entries, and other paging-related parameters.
	•	start.S: The entry point for the kernel on ARM64 systems. This assembly file sets up the initial execution environment before handing control over to the main kernel code.
	•	start.h: A header file associated with start.S, containing declarations and macros used during the startup process.
	•	trap.S: Handles exceptions and interrupts by providing assembly routines to manage traps. It defines the low-level handlers that respond to various CPU exceptions.

Each of these files plays a critical role in ensuring that the TOS-7 operating system functions correctly on ARM64 hardware by managing tasks such as booting, context switching, memory management, and interrupt handling.
